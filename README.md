- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonas.
- 👀 I’m fascinated by the complex world of software development – I have very little knowledge about it! :D
- 🌱 I really enjoy learning how to code. Step by step.
- 🫱🏾‍🫲🏼 I'm always looking for possibilities to extend my skillset. I’m open for collaboration on beginner friendly projects.
- 📫 Just reach out if I can assist you with anything.
